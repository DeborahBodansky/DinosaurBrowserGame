# Project Proposal
For my final project, I want to recreate the dinosaur game that one can play in the Google Chrome browser when there is no internet (not exactly pixel for pixel, but the same concept: a dinosaur running, jumping over cacti, ducking under birds, speeding up as the game progresses, a scoreboard, etc.; also I want to make it in Illini colors because why not). 

If this is considered background, this is probably the first coding project I ever tried doing -- in Scratch, for my AP Computer Science Principles class in high school. I ended up having the dinosaur jump over rolling apples. Other than that, I don't really have that much experience with this project specifically, but I do at this point have some experience using Cinder and the ability to read documentation and figure out what's what. I want to do this project for the same reason I wanted to do it in high school: because I love that game and think it would be fun to implement. Besides this, I will be motivated to see this project to completion by the fact that I am graduating in 6 weeks and it would really suck if I didn't finish this project and couldn't graduate because I already bought my family tickets.

## Project Timeline
### Week 1
I will devote week 1 to setting up my project properly and figuring out how to draw all the required shapes (dinosaur, cactus, bird) and how to animate them (e.g. the dinosaur's legs will need to have two configurations: forward and back; bird wings will need to have two configurations: up and down). I am devoting an entire week to this because judging from the Cinder documentation, I am getting the sense that it will be confusing.

### Week 2
In week 2, I will actually put the dinosaur on the "ground" (he will hit the ground running, so to speak) and figure out how to let the player control his movement with the up button. I will also figure out the animation of how the dinosaur is going to move over the ground and how he will speed up as the game progresses. Essentially, by the end of week 2 I want to fully create an ultra easy version of the game that doesn't have any obstacles. I also plan to implement day/night changes during this week, but if I don't have time, this can easily be moved to week 3.

### Week 3
In week 3, I will add cacti and birds and take care of everything that comes along with that -- including bird movement and what constitutes a dinosaur/cactus or dinosaur/bird collision.

### Week 4
I will use week 4 for general cleanup and features such as: the scoreboard, the losing board, possibly sound effects, etc.

## Stretch goals
If I finish this project early, I might play around with creating multiple avatars (i.e. not just a dinosaur, but maybe also a dog or monkey) and letting the player choose which one they want to play as.
